# Test the application

In this part of the mission, since you have already subscribed to the application, you will test the application using the Tenant administrator user you just created.

1. [Go to Application](#1-Go-to-Application)
2. [Create a new Project](#2-Create-a-new-Project)
3. [Create an Assessment](#3-Create-an-Assessment)
4. [Create a Member User](#4-Create-a-Member-User)
5. [Add a Member](#5-Add-a-Project-Member)
6. [Troubleshooting](#6-Troubleshooting)
7. [Further Information](#7-Further-Information)

Please make sure to conduct the steps of this chapter with a user that was assigned the SaaS application **Admin** role collection. You will learn how to create a user having a regular **Member** role collection within this chapter. 

In case you already completed the Basic Scope, the following steps might be very familiar to you. Still, you can see it as good exercise. 


## 1. Go to Application

Using the **Tenant administrator** you created in the previous chapter please continue with the steps described in the corresponding part of the **Basic Scope** ([click here](../../2-basic/6-test-the-application/README.MD#1-Go-to-application)). 


## 2. Create a new Project

Please continue with the steps described the in corresponding part of the **Basic Scope** ([click here](../../2-basic/6-test-the-application/README.MD#2-create-a-new-project)). 


## 3. Create an Assessment

Please continue with the steps described in the corresponding part of the **Basic Scope** ([click here](../../2-basic/6-test-the-application/README.MD#3-create-an-assessment)). 


## 4. Create a Member User

### Basic steps

Please continue with the steps described in the corresponding part of the **Basic Scope** ([click here](../../2-basic/6-test-the-application/README.MD#4-create-a-member-user)). 

### Additional steps

In addition to the **Basic Scope**, the new user does not necessarily have to exist in SAP ID Service. Theoretically, you can add a user with any random e-mail address. This user will again receive a respective e-mail being asked to register for an SAP Identity Authentication account. This gives your SaaS consumers much more flexibility compared to using SAP ID Service. 


## 5. Add a Project Member

Please continue with the steps described in the corresponding part of the **Basic Scope** ([click here](../../2-basic/6-test-the-application/README.MD#5-add-a-member-to-project)). 


## 6. Troubleshooting

For troubleshooting please check the separate **Troubleshooting** section of the **Basic Scope** ([click here](../../2-basic/10-troubleshooting/README.MD)) and **Advanced Scope** ([click here](../9-troubleshooting/README.MD)).


## 7. Further Information

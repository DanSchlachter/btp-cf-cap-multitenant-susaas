# Introduction to the Expert Scope

> **Important - WIP** <br>
> The **Expert Scope** is still being actively worked on! Feel free to browse the available sections to get an idea of what to expect once published. Some of the chapters already contain useful content while others will be uploaded during the next weeks!

In the [Basic Scope](../../2-basic/0-introduction-basic-scope/README.md) we have provided you the core elements required for a Software as a Service (SaaS) application on SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP). 

In the [Advanced Scope](../../3-advanced/0-introduction-advanced-scope/README.md) we covered some more interesting topics when it comes to enterprise-readiness of your Software as a Service application that goes beyond the usage in a test scenario. 

The idea of **Expert Scope** builds on the Basic and Advanced Scope and features a variety of additional topics that will be relevant for you as a SaaS provider. 

See the following screenshot to get an idea of the Expert Scope architecture.

The **Expert Scope** will cover topics from doing backups of tenant database containers to using a custom domain for your SaaS application. Below you can find the current list of topics (planned to be) covered.  

> **Important** - You can implement some of the Expert Scope topics in a Trial environment (see list above) whereas for other parts you will either need an SAP BTP **Free Tier** or [**Enterprise Account**](https://help.sap.com/docs/BTP/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/171511cc425c4e079d0684936486eee6.html).
